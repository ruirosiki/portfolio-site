      <p>
        This is where I list out all the major technologies as well as going to
        GA. I am going to have the icons for each technology I have worked with.
        The images will be individual and when you hover over each one, it will
        change color from black and white to the color of the actual logo.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />I will also list Fordham and General Assembly on here.
      </p>
    </div>
